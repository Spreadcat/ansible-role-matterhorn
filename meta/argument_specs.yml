            If set to 'single', the application will be constrained to a single
            CPU. This mode can sometimes result in interface input latency. If set
            to 'multiple', the application will use more than one CPU up to an
            application-defined reasonable maximum, or the number of CPUs on the
            host, whichever is smaller."
